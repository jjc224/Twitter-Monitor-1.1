Project notes
-------------

The bonus tasks haven't been sufficiently completed but can be if desired given more time (as noted, the task came to me on short notice and already had weekend commitments).
Feel free to ask if you would like me to continue with this later on.

Also, as noted in my CV, there is a project I did called VividFlow which has a Python backend and is quite immense in its scope.
Feel free to also look into that if you wish to further evaluate ability.
